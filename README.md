# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous projects from courses I've taken. Mind that these projects are not as "polished" as those in other repositories.

## String_functions - MIPS/ASM - Autumn 2018

Some rudimentary string manipulations and additions for MIPS architecture, I have executed them on the self-contained simulator QtSpim, that runs MIPS32 programs. As low-level as it gets.

## split_the_bill - C++ - Summer 2018

Project for splitting the bill
