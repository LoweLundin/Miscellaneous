# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous projects from courses I have taken. Mind that these projects are not as "polished" as those in other repositories. 

## split_the_bill - C++ - Summer 2018

Program for splitting the bill, produced for the course "Computers and Programming". Reads a text file when started and new transactions can also be input. Can show transaction history, settle the bill and more. Sadly, only in Swedish.

## string_functions - MIPS32/ASM - Autumn 2018

Some rudimentary, low-level, string manipulations and additions for MIPS architecture, I have executed them on the self-contained simulator "QtSpim", that runs MIPS32 programs. Produced for the course "Computer Architecture I".

## painter - Python - Spring 2019

Painter automata which follows a set of given rules. Colours, rules, timesteps and more can be costumised giving potentially infinite possibilities of outcomes. The project was produced for the course "Modelling Complex Systems".
